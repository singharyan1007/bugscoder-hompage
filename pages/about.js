            As it already suggests, I'm an undergrad in college pursuing B.E in
            Electronics and Communication Engineering. I had already started
            programming back when I was in 9th standard as we had java in our
            school curriculum. I started web development during 2nd year of my
            engineering and I like working on the web a lot (mostly frontend).
            If you want to know about what programming languages I know, they
            are - javascript, java and little bit of python. I have worked only
            on React and Next.

            I'm also into technical writing and blogging (though my college life
            never lets me do it and so does my lazy ass). I write mostly on
            Dev.to.

            Things I do other than dev and programming? Not much, but I
            overthink and then turn those thoughts into poetry. I also just like
            to go on the terrace with soft music and watch clouds and fighter
            planes pass by ðŸ˜³. I also game a lot (only COD MOBILE). Apart from
            these, I don't have much to do other than overthinking and staring
            at my phone screen and scrolling through pinterest and instagram.

            I don't talk much over any platform but I like making friends though
            I have a close knit group of three people and a bestfriend kinda
            girlfriend(she is pretty cool!!!). So, in case you want to talk
            about anything, just hit me up and I'll get back to you once I'm

            That's pretty much everything I know about me yet. In case you know
            something about me that I still don't, please let me know - I'll add
            it here.
